    `Roses, celebrated globally for their exquisite beauty and fragrance, require specific care to flourish spectacularly each season. The optimal time to plant new roses is during the dormant season, typically in late autumn or early spring, as this reduces transplant shock and allows roots to establish before summer heat [1, 2]. For the best growth, roses thrive in rich, well-draining soil with a slightly acidic pH, and they demand at least six hours of direct sunlight daily [1, 2]. Pruning is a crucial annual task best performed in early spring as the buds begin to swell, which encourages vigorous new growth and abundant blooms [1]. The proper technique involves making clean, angled cuts above an outward-facing bud, removing dead or diseased wood entirely and selectively trimming healthy canes to maintain an open, balanced shape [1, 2]. Feeding roses adequately is vital; use a balanced granular or slow-release fertilizer monthly from early spring through mid-to-late summer to supply necessary nutrients [2, 3]. Supplement this with organic matter, like compost or well-rotted manure, applied as a mulch around the base of the plant [2, 3]. Adhering to these seasonal cycles of planting, pruning, and feeding ensures a healthy, vibrant rose garden.`
